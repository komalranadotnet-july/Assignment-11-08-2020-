    Sania Mirza born 15 November 1986 is an Indian professional tennis player. A former doubles world No. 1, 
    she has won six Grand Slam titles in her career.[3][4] From 2003 until her retirement from singles in 2013, 
    she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as India's No. 1 player. Throughout her career, Mirza has 
    established herself as by far the most successful Indian female tennis player ever and one of the highest-paid 
    and most high-profile athletes in the country.[5][6]

    In her singles career, Mirza had notable wins over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva, and Marion Bartoli, 
    as well as former world No. 1s Martina Hingis, Dinara Safina, and Victoria Azarenka. She is the highest-ranked 
    female player ever from India, peaking at world No. 27 in mid-2007. However, a major wrist injury forced her to 
    give up her singles career and focus on the doubles circuit. She has achieved a number of firsts for women's tennis 
    in her native country, including surpassing $1 million in career earnings (in the end over $6.9 million), winning a 
    singles WTA title, and winning a major title (eventually, three each in women's doubles and in mixed doubles), as well 
    as qualifying for (and eventually winning) the WTA Finals in 2014 alongside Cara Black, 
    defending the title the following year partnering with Martina Hingis.
