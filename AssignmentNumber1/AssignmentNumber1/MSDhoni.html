    Sri Lanka. Dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 
    2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's 
    fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018.

    times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of
