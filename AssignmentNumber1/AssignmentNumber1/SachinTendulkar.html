    Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar(About this soundlisten); born 24 April 1973) is a former international cricketer from India 
    and a former captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history 
    of cricket. He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Considered as the world's most prolific
    batsman of all time, he is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to 
    score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and 
    ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.

    Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi 
    at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four
    years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of
    all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his 
    career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances
    for India.[9] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in 
    South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included 
    in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.He is affectionately 
    known as Little Master or Master Blaster.
