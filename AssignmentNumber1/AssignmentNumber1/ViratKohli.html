    captain of the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen 
    in the world.He plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's

    rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points).

    Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, 
    he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in 
    the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won 
    the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test
    hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[6] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen 
    for the first time in 2013,[7] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament
